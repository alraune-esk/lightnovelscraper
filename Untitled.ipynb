      "Eventually, Shang ceased contemplating Entropy.\n",
      "Though Shang had a strong desire to invest substantial time in understanding Entropy, as he believed he was making progress, he realized it wasn't the most efficient approach at the moment.\n",
      "Before anything else, Shang needed to strengthen his Realm. Immersing himself in comprehending Concepts now would be a waste of time, as Concepts wouldn't evade him.\n",
      "First, he needed to increase his power.\n",
      "Next, he planned to comprehend a few non-essential Destinations.\n",
      "Only after that would he decide on his next focus. At that point, Entropy could be a potential direction.\n",
      "Shang drew the black sphere of Entropy toward himself and absorbed it. This process wasn't any different for Shang than absorbing pure Mana.\n",
      "Immediately after, Shang summoned another Abomination Lord and attempted to provoke it into fighting him.\n",
      " Within minutes, the Abomination Lord halfheartedly launched an attack against Shang.\n",
      "The Abomination Lord demonstrated considerable speed, comparable to that of a Late Beast Lord. Its physical strength also matched that of a Late Beast Lord.\n",
      "It's worth noting that Shang had summoned an Early Abomination Lord.\n",
      "Even disregarding its Domain of Entropy, the Early Abomination Lord had the potential to challenge an Early Mage Lord.\n",
      "Factoring in its Domain of Entropy, the Early Abomination Lord might even pose a threat to Peak Mage Lords and Mid Mage Lord Clouds.\n",
      "An Abomination Lord could leap a level when facing a Cloud.\n",
      "This fact was astonishing and was akin to someone possessing a fivefold Spirit Sense.\n",
      "Each Abomination Lord had the battle strength of a fivefold Spirit Sense individual.\n",
      "This made engaging an Abomination Lord at one's level tantamount to suicide.\n",
      "The Abominations fought instinctively, charging headlong with teeth and claws to kill their enemies.\n",
      "Despite their simple approach, they possessed immense power.\n",
      "Shang wondered how much more potent an Abomination could become with intelligence and combat experience.\n",
      "When this thought occurred to him, he glanced at his right arm with his Spirit Sense.\n",
      "The body of an Abomination Lord was as sturdy as Shang's own body at that level, and they also had access to the Domain of Entropy.\n",
      "Reluctantly, Shang admitted that an Abomination Lord could potentially match his power if it attained human-level intelligence.\n",
      "This realization brought one thing into focus: Abominations were not on the same level as other beings.\n",
      "Humans and beasts were on par with each other.\n",
      "A Beast Lord could become as powerful as a Mage Lord with adequate training, as evidenced by the Thunder King.\n",
      "Abominations, however, possessed physical strength two levels above that of a beast and wielded an immensely powerful domain.\n",
      "I think you should take a look at \n",
      "Even more remarkable, every single Abomination was that formidable.\n",
      "This wasn't an exceptional case of a talented Abomination; the average Abomination was this powerful.\n",
      "The more Shang fought against them, the clearer it became that Abominations were not native to this world.\n",
      "Everything about them was distinct, and their power surpassed that of ordinary beings.\n",
      "While the world seemed to maintain a balance, allowing every Path to reach the same level of power, Abominations stood apart.\n",
      "They were unequivocally superior.\n",
      "This raised questions about their origin: Were they truly from this world, within Aterium, or had they come from outside?\n",
      "Could the God truly stop them?\n",
      "Shang couldn't be entirely certain about his conjectures, but he felt confident that Abominations were not naturally existing in Aterium.\n",
      "He firmly believed that Abominations originated from outside Aterium and invaded the realm, possibly drawn by the abundant Mana.\n",
      "In his battles against the Abomination, Shang experienced no difficulties, as its most potent weapon, the Domain of Entropy, had no effect on him, turning them into stronger but less intelligent beasts.\n",
      "After absorbing the Early Abomination Lord, Shang summoned a Late Abomination Lord and engaged it in combat.\n",
      "The Late Abomination Lord possessed a body as robust as an Initial Beast King, an entire Realm above Shang's level.\n",
      "Although the Abomination still fought like an animal, the sheer difference in speed and power exerted immense pressure on Shang's body.\n",
      "For the next couple of years, this became Shang's routine-absorbing Abominations to elevate his level while also honing his swordsmanship.\n",
      "Though he hadn't explored the non-essential Destinations for Warrior Kings, Shang believed that refining his sword skills would benefit him in the future.\n",
      "Over the next 500 years, Shang didn't acquire any new knowledge, as that wasn't his primary goal. However, he managed to reach the Early Sword Lord Realm.\n",
      "If allowed to utilize his Domain of Entropy, Shang could potentially triumph over Late Mage Lord Clouds and might even have a slim chance against a Thunder.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, Shang had surpassed the majority of Bolts and all existing Beast Lords.\n",
      "His strength slowly elevated him to the top of the world, reaching the top 5,000 beings in Aterium.\n",
      "Only a few thousand entities in the entire realm were stronger than him.\n",
      "During his second trial, Shang had battled the progeny of the Ice King, but back then, he couldn't have comprehended the true power of the Ice King.\n",
      "The Ice King had ranked within the top thousand of the world, a position Shang was now close to achieving.\n",
      "Having attained the Early Sword Lord Realm, Shang left his Isolation Barrier and contacted Amarius, aware that the Empress of Death had likely broken the contract by now.\n",
      "With the next round of war commencing, the Lightning Manor required his presence.\n",

      "The man's eyes looked at the back of the room.\n",
      "Another man was sitting on a chair behind a mahogany desk. Several papers were strewn across the desk, and the man practically lay in his chair, his head looking upward.\n",
      "The man at the door slightly shook his head and walked over.\n",
      "Bang!\n",
      "He slightly kicked the table.\n",
      "\"Oh, wha- huh? Oh, good morning, Wester,\" the man who had just been sleeping said after recovering from the shock. He was an old man with gentle facial features, and everyone that saw him would believe him to be a nice grandpa.\n",
      "\"It's evening, sir,\" Wester, the butler, said to the old man.\n",
      "\"Oh, already?\" the old man asked in confusion as he looked around his room. \"I was working on this year's reward for the Clan Tournament. Guess I lost track of time,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Mhm,\" Wester uttered, deciding not to comment on how he had found his master napping.\n",
      "\"What? You don't believe me?\" the old man asked with an offended expression. \"Look! It's over there,\" he said.\n",
      "A tome started to float from the desk and stopped in front of Wester.\n",
      "Wester took the tome, opened it, and scanned through it.\n",
      "\"An Element-Neutral King Rank Spell,\" Wester commented. \"You didn't read the dossiers about the candidates, did you?\" Wester asked.\n",
      "The old man felt like he had been found out.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "Wester put his hands on the stacked dossiers on the table, making it impossible for the old man to peek at them.\n",
      "The old man groaned. \"Fine! Fine!\" he groaned, \"but it doesn't really matter, does it? Element-Neutral Spells are worth more than Element-Specific Spells anyway.\"\n",
      "\"Sir, if you keep creating Element-Neutral Spells for every tournament, the other Clans will start believing that we don't care about the tournament,\" Wester commented.\n",
      "The old man groaned again. \"Fine! I'll just create one for every Element, and you can choose whichever you want to hand out in the future tournaments.\"\n",
      "Wester put the Element-Neutral King Rank Spell under his arm but didn't comment on the old man's words.\n",
      "Silence.\n",
      "The old man felt a bit awkward as his butler only stood before him, not saying anything.\n",
      "\"Do you need something else?\" the old man asked.\n",
      "Silence.\n",
      "\"The Child of Calamity has vanished,\" Wester said.\n",
      "The old man was a bit taken aback as he looked at Wester with skepticism. \"Vanished? Did he flee? Why would he? He had money, freedom, status, a family, everything. What happened?\"\n",
      "\"We don't know,\" Wester said. \"When our people arrived at his home for their monthly visit, he was simply gone.\"\n",
      "\"Did you search for him?\" the old man asked.\n",
      "\"Of course, sir,\" Wester answered. \"I sent the seventh legion to search through every particle of the surrounding 50,000 kilometers. As a mere Apprentice, he couldn't possibly have traveled further, and we would have noticed any spatial fluctuations. However, we still couldn't find him.\"\n",
      "The old man scratched his chin in thought. \"Not even the other Clans could have hidden something like that. Additionally, they would only be shooting a fireball in their own faces by taking him away. I'm certain that he hadn't had any help.\"\n",
      "\"That only means that his Affinity has claimed his own life. That would also explain why you can't find a trace of him,\" the old man muttered.\n",
      "Wester nodded. \"That is also our assumption.\"\n",
      "The old man also nodded. \"I presume you need the seal?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"Yes, sir.\"\n",
      "The old man gestured with his hand for Wester to give him something, and a piece of paper appeared in the air, which then floated to the desk.\n",
      "The old man looked at the paper and read it.\n",
      "Then, he put his finger at the bottom of the piece of paper, and his finger shone with purple lightning for an instant.\n",
      "\"As always,\" the old man commented as the paper flew back to Wester.\n",
      "\"As always,\" Wester said.\n",
      "Wester turned around, left the study, and wished the old man a good evening.\n",
      "After Wester left, the old man looked with furrowed brows at the middle of the room.\n",
      "The old man waved his fingers. Some water gathered in the air, and a clear pool formed.\n",
      "The old man looked into the pool, and the pool reflected a seemingly infinite world.\n",
      "The old man's eyes moved with rapid speeds as he scanned through every hidden corner of the world in the pool.\n",
      "Ten seconds later, the pool vanished, and the old man laid back on the chair.\n",
      "\"Sure enough, he's gone. No trace of him. That's a new one,\" the old man mumbled to himself. \"I mean, Affinities can eat up their owners, so it's not really unbelievable. It just hasn't happened with the Child of Calamity before in the past 100,000 years. This smells fishy! Something's different this time!\"\n",
      "The old man scratched his chin for a while longer, but then he put his head back in a sleeping position.\n",
      "\"Well, doesn't matter. The legions will find the new Child of Calamity anyway,\" he commented to himself as he closed his eyes.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Wester was walking through a dimly lit hallway made of stone. Every step he took seemingly pulled him forward for hundreds of meters. It was difficult to discern what was more surprising, the fact that Wester was moving this quickly or the fact that the hallway was so long.\n",
      "After some seconds, Wester arrived in front of a wooden door, which he quickly opened and walked out of.\n",
      "Wester arrived in a grand hall.\n",
      "The hall was two kilometers long and 300 meters high. Powerful weapons and adornments were on the walls as imposing, violet flags hung down from every column. The flags had white lightning bolts imprinted on them, and a gigantic table was in the middle of the hall with some chairs surrounding it.\n",
      "Right now, the hall was empty.\n",
      "Wester went through another door and down another hallway, this hallway being far bigger and grander than the previous one.\n",
      "Wester walked through another door.\n",
      "This room had several tables and chairs. Many different kinds of magical equipment could be found in the room. Several papers and different objects were on the desks.\n",
      "\"Good evening, sir. Do you require something?\"\n",
      "A blonde woman with ostentatious purple robes stood up politely. Electricity sparked around her as space seemed to bend around her.\n",
      "She exuded incredible power.\n",
      "\"Oh, Sarah, perfect, I was searching for you. Everything going well?\" Wester asked politely.\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Thank you for asking, sir,\" the woman spoke politely.\n",
      "\"Sarah, I need you to do something for me,\" Wester said politely as he took out the paper the old man had signed earlier.\n",
      "The paper floated over, and the woman looked at the paper.\n",
      "Her eyes widened more and more as she continued reading. \"Yes, sir,\" she said.\n",
      "Then, she took the paper and walked over to a wall. She spoke complex and unfamiliar words that warped her surroundings.\n",
      "Ten seconds later, an outcropping in the shape of a piece of paper appeared on the wall.\n",
      "Sarah put the paper in the outcropping, and the paper burned away.\n",
      "DING! DING! DING!\n",
      "Three bells rang throughout an unfathomable distance, their sounds ignoring the upper limit of the speed of sound.\n",
      "\"Have a good hunt,\" Wester commented politely as he left the room.\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir,\" Sarah said with a bow.\n",
      "SHING!\n",
      "Sarah was engulfed by a bright light, but the bright light vanished just as quickly as it had arrived.\n",
      "However, Sarah had undergone a world-shaking transformation.\n",
      "Her purple robes were replaced by a shining silver armor, covered with different runes. Golden wing bones were on the back of her armor, which were quickly filled out by bolts of lightning, resembling the feathers.\n",
      "A two-meter-long spear appeared in her hands, also crackling with lightning.\n",
      "SHING!\n",
      "Then, Sarah seemingly vanished.\n",
      "She had teleported away!\n",
      "SHING!\n",
      "Sarah reappeared in the grand hall through which Wester had gone.\n",
      "However, the hall was no longer empty.\n",
      "10,000 people in golden armor with golden staves filled the hall in an orderly manner.\n",
      "\"We greet the general!\" the ten people at the front of the army spoke in unison.\n",
      "Sarah exuded irresistible power as she looked at the gathered army.\n",
      "This was the sixth legion, which was responsible for reconnaissance.\n",
      " \"Men and women of the sixth legion,\" Sarah said, her voice echoing throughout the grand hall. \"The Ancestor has given an order!\"\n",
      "Silence.\n",
      "\"The Child of Calamity has vanished, and a new Child of Calamity must have appeared in the world. The sixth legion will comb the world. Every child in the world below the age of one must have their Affinity tested with a blood test! If any child tests positive for an unknown affinity, the child will be brought to me personally!\"\n",
      "\"I expect you all to finish by the morning!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, General!\" all the soldiers echoed.\n",
      "\"Go!\"\n",
      "SHING! SHING! SHING!\n",
      "All 10,000 people teleported out of the hall and reappeared in the air outside the building.\n",
      "Below them was a magnificent purple castle, built on top of several mountains of unfathomable height.\n",
      "The castle itself was several kilometers wide!\n",
      "Lightning crackled violently on the storm clouds below the mountains where the castle was built on.\n",
      "Nothing aside from an endless sea of clouds filled with lightning could be seen.\n",
      "The 10,000 people in the air crackled with lightning as their bodies shone in golden light.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "Then, with an explosion, all soldiers transformed into lightning as they shot into the horizon.\n",
      "Their speed was impossible to follow with one's eyes.\n",
      "On this night, many humans would notice golden shooting stars in the sky.\n",
      "On this night, all babies below the age of one would gain a tiny red dot on the fingertip of their index finger.\n",
      "This was where the blood was drawn from for the test.\n",
      "No one but the peak powers would notice that this had even happened.\n",
      "The entire world had been combed in but a single night and no one had noticed.\n",
      "Yet, the Child of Calamity had not been found.\n",

      "A superficially cheerful voice shouted this phrase from a medium-sized grocery store. The phrase was targeted at a middle-aged man that was just leaving the store. The middle-aged man slightly waved one of his hands to show that he had heard, but he couldn't be bothered to answer.\n",
      "As soon as the man left, the grocery store cashier sighed and went back to the cash register. The cashier was a young man with blonde hair, and he looked like he had just hit his 20s. A slight muscular frame was still visible when one looked at him from the back, but when looking at him from the front, one could only see a rather sizable beer belly.\n",
      "Clack, thump, clack, thump!\n",
      "As the cashier walked back to the cash register, the sound of his cane could be heard on the floor of the grocery store.\n",
      "\"Hello, welcome to Stevie's!\" the cashier greeted with superficial politeness as he handled the next customer.\n",
      "\"Hard day at work, huh?\" the young customer asked the cashier.\n",
      "\"It's alright,\" the cashier answered with a slight chuckle. \"Everyone has to make a living.\"\n",
      "However, these words didn't reflect the cashier's real feelings.\n",
      "'This fucking grocery store is killing me, I swear!' he thought as he \"happily\" bagged the groceries. 'Every day with the same shit. Alex, do this! Alex, do that! I swear, when I've saved up enough money for college, I'm going to burn this place to the ground!'\n",
      "Of course, these were only thoughts created in a stressful situation. Alex knew that he wouldn't really do it.\n",
      "This cashier was Alexander Hoffmann.\n",
      "Alex for short.\n",
      "Alex's life hadn't always been like this.\n",
      "He had had a bright future ahead of him in the past.\n",
      "Sadly, life didn't go his way.\n",
      "On the urging of his father, Alex started doing sports when he was 12. After all, doing sports while growing was very beneficial to the development of a teenager.\n",
      "Alex's father was a huge fan of the MNFA, the Multinational Fighting Association.\n",
      "The MNFA let fighters from nearly all disciplines of martial arts fight each other with the least rules possible. So, in short, it was an organization that handled mixed martial arts fights, MMA for short.\n",
      "Alex had also grown to like watching these fights, and when his father urged him to do some sports, Alex decided that he wanted to do MMA.\n",
      "His parents' feelings were mixed on that subject.\n",
      "On one hand, it was great that their child was finally doing some sports, but MMA could get pretty dangerous if something wasn't handled correctly.\n",
      "However, since it was not professional MMA and since there were several coaches around in the local gym, they agreed.\n",
      "Some time later, when Alex had had his first practice fight against another kid in the gym, he got his ass handed to him. Yet, this experience awakened a certain kind of stubbornness in him, an urge to win.\n",
      "Sadly, he lost the next couple of practice matches too. Well, one couldn't really consider these matches a loss since they weren't real matches. They were simply some sparring between two students.\n",
      "Yet, when Alex didn't clearly win a fight, he saw it as a loss.\n",
      "Alex had already planned to change sports and join another one since it felt frustrating to see how everyone was better than himself. Yet, he wanted to win at least one time!\n",
      "So, he continued training, and eventually, he won.\n",
      "When Alex won, he felt something that he had never felt before.\n",
      "It was a kind of indescribable high!\n",
      "He felt like he was floating on clouds, and he felt like he was the greatest in the world!\n",
      "The feeling of fighting, which had always annoyed him since his body hurt after it, transformed into the polar opposite.\n",
      "This feeling of fighting others wasn't annoying.\n",
      "It was simply a clash between men!\n",
      "They were showcasing their power in a very primal fashion!\n",
      "Alex wanted to feel this feeling again!\n",
      "Alex stayed in the gym and even came more often. MMA had transformed from a chore into a hobby. The pain of sore muscles became a familiar pain that Alex even started to enjoy. It sounded cheesy, but the common phrase of every single sports coach in the world resonated with Alex.\n",
      "\"Pain is simply weakness leaving your body!\"\n",
      "As the years passed, Alex completely focused on MMA. Even his grades started to drop, which had already been average to begin with. Alex wasn't stupid, but he never paid attention in school and didn't learn anything.\n",
      "Stuff like math and physics was still okay since he could often deduce the correct answers logically, which was why those grades didn't suffer much. However, subjects like history and foreign languages had it far worse since one had to actually learn for these things.\n",
      "Alex had a ton of arguments with his parents over this, but Alex always said that his future was MMA. He would join the MNFA, and he would earn a ton of money!\n",
      "Alex barely passed high school but decided against going to college.\n",
      "MMA was his future!\n",
      "Alex trained as hard as he could!\n",
      "His entire life depended on his success!\n",
      "If he didn't manage to get into the MNFA, he would lose!\n",
      "And one day, just after Alex's 20th birthday, he got accepted!\n",
      "This was the greatest day of his life!\n",
      "His dream was about to become a reality!\n",
      "Alex won his first match pretty easily since his first opponent was pretty weak. His horrible win-loss record proved that.\n",
      "Alex also won his second match, but it was a close one.\n",
      "Yet, tragedy struck at Alex's third match.\n",
      "The fight had been going fine. There was some back and forth, and he and his opponent were pretty evenly matched.\n",
      "And then, the accident happened.\n",
      "Alex and his opponent had been fighting from a distance since no one managed to find a good opening to tackle the other one to the ground. Alex saw an opening in his opponent's defense and performed a roundhouse kick.\n",
      "CRACK!\n",
      "His opponent barely recovered before the kick struck, and he managed to block it haphazardly.\n",
      "His opponent's elbow hit Alex's ankle.\n",
      "Alex's ankle immediately broke, and the medics jumped into the ring.\n",
      "A day later, Alex got the news that his bones had damaged the nerves and muscles in his leg.\n",
      "They could only fix it to the point that would allow him to walk somewhat normally with the support of a cane, but that was it. There was nothing more they could do.\n",
      "Alex's career was over.\n",
      "From the highest high of his life, Alex fell to the lowest low.\n",
      "Alex had earned quite a sum of money from his three fights, but he basically wasted all of it in a drunken haze of destruction over the next year.\n",
      "His life was over.\n",
      "There was nothing anymore.\n",
      "After a year, his family held an intervention for him, and Alex finally realized that he had to stop being such a pussy. One year was more than enough to wallow in self-pity!\n",
      "So, Alex planned to save up some money for college.\n",
      "Right now, Alex was 22 years old, and he was working in a grocery store precisely for this reason.\n",
      "Even though his past was filled with incredible highs, and even though he fell into the lowest low, Alex was still young, and he knew that he could still make something of his life. He only had to work his ass off for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Then, he would go to college, and everything would turn for the better!\n",
      "Time passed in the grocery store, and after helping close up the place, Alex left at around 10 pm. It was already dark out, but the streets were well lit. After all, Alex lived and worked in a less savory part of a big city.\n",
      "As Alex stepped out of the grocery store, his nose wrinkled. No matter how long he had lived here, he simply couldn't get used to the disgusting stench of the dirty streets.\n",
      "This part of the city was for low-income families, and the state of the streets reflected that very well.\n",
      "Garbage, cigarette butts, old newspapers, old furniture.\n",
      " This was a common sight on these streets.\n",
      "Alex tried to ignore the stench and walked home. His home was barely a kilometer away, a distance where people argued if they should drive or walk.\n",
      "Alex was walking since he wanted to keep his living costs as low as possible. Additionally, Alex somewhat enjoyed the walk since he was used to doing a lot of physical exercise.\n",
      "After some minutes, Alex stopped as he looked at a couple of cigarette butts on the street.\n",
      "And the cigarette bin right beside them.\n",
      "'Oh, come on!' he thought. 'The bin is right there!'\n",
      "Alex used his cane to push the cigarette butts to the side of the closest building. He hated these people that treated the streets as their own toilet, but he didn't hate them enough to pick up the cigarette butts to throw them away.\n",
      "After some minutes, Alex heard the sound of a whining dog, and he stopped.\n",
      "This wasn't the usual sound of a whining dog.\n",
      "The dog's whining was very loud, high-pitched, painful, and desperate. Obviously, the dog was in a ton of pain.\n",
      "The sound of dogs was normal in this city, but that sound definitely wasn't normal.\n",
      "Alex searched around for the dog and found it in a dark alleyway between two buildings.\n",
      "The dog could barely be seen at the edge of the streetlamps' lights.\n",
      "Blood.\n",
      "Bone.\n",
      "A concerned look appeared on Alex's face as he saw the dog. Both of its hindlegs were severely broken. He could see blood coming out of its legs, and he could even see its bones poking out.\n",
      "No wonder it was in so much pain.\n",
      "Alex thought about if he should help it or not. He didn't have a pet, but he also didn't hate animals. It was nice to look at and interact with them, but he didn't want to bear the responsibility of owning a pet of his own.\n",
      "On top of that, pets were expensive.\n",
      "Yet, when Alex saw the broken legs, he got reminded of his own injury. A slight pain came from his ankle as the scene of being rushed into the hospital returned to Alex's mind.\n",
      "In the end, Alex sighed.\n",
      "'Fine, I'll bring you to a vet, but I won't pay much for your care.'\n",
      "Alex slowly walked into the alleyway and closed in on the dog. The dog didn't move and only continued crying in pain as Alex came closer.\n",
      "\"Don't move!\"\n",
      "Alex stopped as the familiar feeling of adrenaline rushing through his veins assaulted him.\n",
      "There was a knife at his throat!\n",
      "Alex didn't dare to move as panic took hold of him, but he calmed down somewhat when he felt a hand hurriedly searching through his pockets.\n",
      "'A robbery,' Alex thought.\n",
      "Alex had only been in panic for two seconds, but his old fighting instincts kicked in.\n",
      "Yet, Alex didn't attack.\n",
      "It was essential to analyze the opponent first. Otherwise, mistakes were bound to happen.\n",
      "As the hand of the robber searched through Alex's pocket, Alex slightly glanced at the robber. He wore a black hoody and black sweatpants. It was hard to make out his facial features in the darkness while looking at him from such an awkward angle.\n",
      "Alex glanced at the arm that held the knife.\n",
      "'He's gripping the knife with so much force that his arm is shaking, and the knife is also not directly touching my neck. He's probably new at this. Additionally, his arm is basically touching my shoulder.'\n",
      "Alex also noted the appearance and condition of the dog.\n",
      "'They injured the dog to lure me into this alleyway. A clever but cruel trick.'\n",
      "However, a slight smirk appeared on Alex's face.\n",
      "'Sadly, you chose the wrong target!'\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "Alex's head shot backward and hit the lowered head of the robber. At the same time, Alex violently shoved his shoulder upward, pushing the knife away from him.\n",
      "The robber became disoriented. It was never a good feeling to butt heads with another person.\n",
      "Alex was in just as much pain, but as a former fighter, he could still make rational decisions under pain.\n",
      "Without hesitation, Alex lifted his cane.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "And hit the side of the robber's head with full force.\n",
      "The robber immediately lost his consciousness under the attack. Alex hadn't fought in over a year, but his muscles were still more powerful than average.\n",
      "The robber fell over as Alex smirked.\n",
      "CRACK!\n",
      "Alex's smirk froze as it slowly transformed into terror.\n",
      "'No! I didn't want to do that!'\n",
      "Since the robber had lost consciousness, his body simply fell over to the side.\n",
      "And his head violently hit the hard pavement.\n",
      "A pool of dark blood was quickly forming below the robber's cracked skull.\n",
      "Alex's world stopped.\n",
      "He couldn't comprehend what was happening.\n",
      "Didâ¦ did he just kill someone?\n",
      "Alex began hyperventilating in panic as his mind tried to comprehend the magnitude of what he had just done.\n",
      "CRACK!\n",
      "And then, Alex's mind vanished.\n",
      "Alex's body landed beside the robbers.\n",
      "A huge crack could be seen at the back of his head.\n",
      "Behind Alex's body stood another man dressed in black, fury on his face. In his hand, he carried a blood-smeared crowbar.\n",
      "This was the robber's friend, who had been hiding behind some trash in case something went wrong.\n",
      "When he saw the corpse of his friend, fury took hold of him, and he hit Alex on the back of the head with his crowbar, full force.\n",
      "Alex died instantly.\n",
      "He didn't even know how he had died.\n",
      "\"Fuck! FUCK!\" the second robber shouted as he didn't know what he should do now.\n",
      "He had two corpses on his hands now!\n",
      "While the robber was panicking, two invisible, azure wisps left the corpses.\n",
      "The azure wisps traveled into the sky and seemingly left the realm of earth.\n",
      "Alex didn't feel alive nor dead.\n",
      "He was awake but also not awake.\n",
      "One could liken the state of his mind to dreaming. His mind didn't work properly, but there were still some rudimentary thoughts that appeared.\n",
      "The azure wisps entered an empty void, and they stopped.\n",
      "Many other wisps were there already, and new ones joined every second.\n",
      "After a minute, a bright, white light suddenly appeared in the nothingness, and all the wisps flew to it.\n",
      "They were inherently drawn to it.\n",
      "This was where they were supposed to go.\n",
      "These were the souls of the dead, and Alex was just one insignificant soul among many.\n",
      "Suddenly, the void shook!\n",
      "It was like reality was being torn apart!\n",
      "However, the wisps only continued to travel to the light. They didn't even notice what was happening.\n",
      "Reality seemingly broke like glass as an even darker hole appeared.\n",
      "Then, a gigantic hand shot out of the hole.\n",
      "It was the hand of a young, adult man.\n",
      "With unreal speeds, the hand shot at one particular wisp, Alex's soul.\n",
      "The hand used its thumb and index finger to clamp down on Alex's soul, and Alex felt clarity return to his mind.\n",
      "'Wait, what happened?'\n",
      "Yet, before Alex could look at his surroundings, he felt himself being pulled into the distance.\n",
      "Before the hand vanished into the closing rift of reality, Alex could hear a voice, and that voice only spoke one word:\n",

      "\"What? What happened? Where am I!?\"\n",
      "Alex's mind was confused beyond belief. He knew that something had happened to him. He felt like he had been dreaming, and just now woke up.\n",
      "However, he had no idea where he was.\n",
      "Alex only knew that he was currently standing in the most imposing hall he had ever seen in his entire life. Just the sheer size of this place struck him dumb. Alex suspected that this hall was over a kilometer wide! It was probably even a hundred meters tall!\n",
      "Who would build such a thing!?\n",
      "The entire place was colored in black and red, evoking a kind of evil feeling.\n",
      "'Did they hire some teenager to design this place? Who colors such a grand hall in black and red?' Alex thought as his brows furrowed. 'Even more, why is everything empty? Sure, there are some things at the walls, but there is nothing in between them except for this big, dark carpet.'\n",
      "Alex looked at the carpet and noticed that something was embroidered on it.\n",
      "It was a white jester's mask. Basically, it was a white mask with the face of a laughing person.\n",
      "'Creepy.'\n",
      "Alex looked to the front, and his eyes widened.\n",
      "About a hundred meters to Alex's front was a vast and tall throne. The throne was probably over ten meters wide and reached the ceiling of this gigantic hall.\n",
      "Alex also noticed that someone was sitting on the throne.\n",
      "It was a young man, probably in his early twenties, just like Alex. He had long black and red hair, but Alex couldn't see how long his hair was exactly since this man was currently facing Alex, looking at him with a smirk.\n",
      "Another interesting aspect of the man's appearance was his red eyes, but Alex didn't notice them from such a distance.\n",
      "Although, he also looked a bit ridiculous since he was far too small for such a wide throne.\n",
      "'Is that a goth kid?' Alex thought. 'Wait, as far as I know, goths are more black and grey. I think emos are more black and red. Did he design this place? Probably, judging by his get-up.'\n",
      "Alex continued staring at the young man while the young man only smirked back.\n",
      "Seconds passed.\n",
      "Alex was looking awkwardly from side to side. The other party wasn't initiating a conversation and only stared at him.\n",
      "Should he initiate a conversation?\n",
      "Well, he had enough questions, so why not?\n",
      "\"Excuse me!\" Alex shouted loudly, his voice echoing in the vast, empty hall. After all, the man was around 100 meters away from him.\n",
      "No reaction.\n",
      "'Maybe he didn't hear me?' Alex thought, unsure.\n",
      "Alex took a step forward.\n",
      "Thump!\n",
      "Alex fell forward and barely caught himself with his hands.\n",
      "'What? Where's my cane?!' Alex thought in panic as he searched around for his cane. Sadly, he couldn't find it.\n",
      "'I mean, I can kind of walk without a cane, but it's awkward as fuck,' Alex thought as he stood up.\n",
      "His balance was rather stable, which surprised him. Usually, due to the nerve damage in his ankle, his right foot always awkwardly flopped around. Alex could only stand on that foot by perfectly balancing his bodyweight along his entire leg.\n",
      "Alex took one step forward, and he took a deep breath in shock as he realized that he could use his right foot!\n",
      "How?!\n",
      "Alex balanced on his left leg as he moved his right foot in the air.\n",
      "Full mobility!\n",
      "No awkwardness!\n",
      "Whoooosh!\n",
      "Alex performed a roundhouse kick, and his mind was going wild.\n",
      "This was just like back when he had been fighting!\n",
      "'What the hell?!'\n",
      "Alex tried out his right leg some more as he jumped and kicked a couple of times.\n",
      "However, after some seconds, Alex deflated with a sigh. 'There's no way my foot is actually healed. Even if it had been healed, there should be some minor awkwardness in my movement, and some of the muscles in my foot should have atrophied.'\n",
      "'This is obviously a dream.'\n",
      "BOOOOM!\n",
      "The sound of an explosion rang throughout the hall, coming from Alex's front! The sound was so loud that Alex's ears started ringing as he was thrown back by a shockwave.\n",
      "Luckily, the shockwave didn't injure him.\n",
      "\"Every damn time!\" an angry voice shouted.\n",
      "Alex shook his head to regain his calm.\n",
      "\"Every damn time!\" the voice repeated, obviously working itself into a rage. \"Every time I get a soul from your world, they always think that it's a dream!\"\n",
      "Alex lifted his head and looked towards the throne.\n",
      "Was the young man speaking?\n",
      "It was hard to see from such a distance.\n",
      "'Wait, then how can I hear him? It sounds like he's just beside me.'\n",
      "\"This is getting boring!\" the voice said with annoyance. \"How about, one time, one of you guys just walks forward? How about, one time, one of you guys just walks up to me?\"\n",
      "Alex looked around as he tried to find the origin of the voice, but there was nothing around him. On top of that, the voice was coming from the front.\n",
      "Was it really that young man?\n",
      "\"Every damn time, I watch you guys, and every damn time, you do the same fucking thing!\" the man shouted.\n",
      "Alex saw that the man's body was slightly moving from side to side, but it was hard to judge from such a distance.\n",
      "\"Oh, what's this hall? Oh, what happened to my body?\" the man shouted with a sarcastic tone.\n",
      "'I think he lifted his right arm to imitate someone speaking,' Alex thought as he concentrated on the throne in the distance.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "Another explosion, but this time, Alex managed to barely remain upright.\n",
      "However, this explosion was even more shocking than the first one.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Because Alex had seen what had caused the explosion.\n",
      "The young man had lifted his right arm and then slammed down.\n",
      "And then, something shocking happened.\n",
      "The armrest of the throne moved inward and stopped below the young man's fist!\n",
      "A ten-meter-wide throne had shrunken to just a bit more than five meters!\n",
      "And the explosion?\n",
      "That was the young man's fist!\n",
      "Just the mere act of slamming one's fist down on an armrest had thrown Alex to the ground from a distance of over a hundred meters.\n",
      "That was insane!\n",
      "All of this took some time to describe, but barely any time had passed in reality. The young man was still ranting.\n",
      "\"And then. And then! And then you always say the same fucking words! You always say 'excuse me'! Can't you say something else for a change?! Can't at least one of you guys say 'hello' or 'good morning' or 'fuck you' or just ANYTHING else?!\"\n",
      "Alex still couldn't deal with the situation.\n",
      "'Okay, that's impossible. This must be a dream!' he thought.\n",
      "Whoooop!\n",
      "Suddenly, the distance between Alex and the man shrank. In less than a second, Alex stood barely half a meter in front of the man.\n",
      "\"What did you just fucking think?!\" the young man growled with narrowed eyes. \"I dare you! Think that one more time! See what happens!\"\n",
      "For some reason, Alex felt terrified right now.\n",
      "Usually, he wouldn't be afraid of a young man sitting on a throne, but for some reason, Alex felt like he had to be very careful right now. Otherwise, he might make a mistake he would regret!\n",
      "Alex looked nervously into the eyes of the young man while the young man glared back.\n",
      "\"Then, how about I say it instead?\" Alex asked.\n",
      "The young man blinked a couple of times in surprise.\n",
      "\"Oh, that's a new one,\" he said, all his rage gone. \"Do go on ahead. I want to see how this plays out.\"\n",
      "Alex gulped.\n",
      "\"This is obviously a dream,\" Alex said.\n",
      "\"What makes you think so?\" the young man asked as he leaned back. The distant back of the throne moved forward of its own volition.\n",
      "\"That,\" Alex said as he pointed at the back of the throne. \"Thrones don't do that.\"\n",
      "\"Mine does,\" the man said with a smirk.\n",
      "\"How?\" Alex asked. He wanted to know how the guy could rationalize something like that.\n",
      "\"Like this.\"\n",
      "Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!\n",
      "Suddenly, the entire hall became wavy. Walls were shooting at Alex and then going far into the distance. The throne was even waving around like one of these wacky inflatable arm tube men on the streets.\n",
      " Surprisingly, Alex stayed calm.\n",
      "\"See?\" Alex said calmly. \"Obviously a dream.\"\n",
      "The hall stopped, and the young man wrinkled his nose.\n",
      "\"Alright, this is getting boring.\"\n",
      "SHING!\n",
      "And Alex's right foot was cut off at his ankle, just like that.\n",
      "The young man didn't even move.\n",
      "Alex fell to the ground in surprise and looked at his bleeding stump of a foot. His face turned into horror, but after two seconds, it surprisingly went back to a calm expression.\n",
      "\"See? I don't feel any pain,\" Alex said. \"Therefore, this is a dream.\"\n",
      "The young man chuckled.\n",
      "\"You're under shock. Give it some seconds,\" the young man said with a smirk.\n",
      "Alex only looked with skepticism at the young man and then back at his right foot. He moved his right leg around a bit in morbid curiosity.\n",
      "Some seconds passed.\n",
      "Alex's face turned into a slight grimace. \"Okay, maybe it stings a little.\"\n",
      "\"Give it time,\" the young man said.\n",
      "Alex started sweating as his breathing quickened.\n",
      "\"Okay, maybe it stings a lot.\"\n",
      "\"Give it time,\" the young man repeated with a smirk.\n",
      "\"Maybeâ¦ maybeâ¦ argh!\"\n",
      "Alex's voice stopped as his hand went to his right leg. His entire body was straining itself as it became harder for him to breathe.\n",
      "And then, Alex lost it.\n",
      "However, he couldn't be blamed for his poor reaction. Take a normal person from a street and cut their leg off. See how they react.\n",
      "\"There we go,\" the young man said with a smirk. \"Now, do you-\"\n",
      "\"Aaaargh!\"\n",
      "The young man's brows furrowed. \"Okay, now do-\"\n",
      "\"Aaaargh!\"\n",
      "\"Shut up!\"\n",
      "Whooop!\n",
      "Suddenly, all the pain disappeared.\n",
      "Alex's mind was shocked.\n",
      "Wait, what?\n",
      "Alex looked down and saw that his right foot was back.\n",
      "'What?'\n",
      "\"You done?!\" the young man asked with an annoyed tone. \"You got that outta your system, yes, or do you want to shout some more?\"\n",
      "Alex couldn't comprehend the situation as he tried to make sense of everything.\n",
      "\"Alright, this is taking too long!\" the young man said as he stood up.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "And then he kicked Alex into the side, throwing him two meters into the distance.\n",
      "\"Alright, so,\" the man began as he continued walking to Alex. \"You died. You are dead. This is not a dream.\"\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "Another kick.\n",
      "Alex coughed several times. These kicks were no joke!\n",
      "The man continued walking to Alex. \"You were just on your way to the afterlife, and that's when I grabbed your soul.\"\n",
      "Alex started to get up, but before he could straighten himself, he got hit by another kick that threw him into the distance.\n",
      "\"I've transported you to my Realm,\" the young man said with a smirk as his hands gestured to the hall around him. \"This is my personal palace.\"\n",
      "Alex quickly got up as the young man reached him again.\n",
      "Whoosh!\n",
      "The young man's kick missed as Alex turned his upper body sideways.\n",
      "BANG!\n",
      "And then, Alex punched the young man in the face!\n",
